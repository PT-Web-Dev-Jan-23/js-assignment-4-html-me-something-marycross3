         <h1>A traveler is born</h1>
         <article>All I ever wanted to do as a child was travel. My parents took us on the typical
            vacations as a child. Like every other middle-class midwestern family we went to 
            the beach, the Lake of the Ozarks and the Smokey Mountains. I enjoyed those trips 
            a lot and credit my parents for my love of travel. They taught me that trips don't have
            to be extravagent, expensive affairs, but that driving 14 hours can take to to what feels 
            like a different planet.

         <h1>The spot</h1>
         <p>My husband found this hidden gem after we took a chance on cheap airfare to Norway on 
            a whim with no prior knowledge of what the country has to offer in regards to traveling 
            or photography. But when you find a flight to a new country for &euro;540 round trip for 
            two, you take it and ask questions later. As with any trip, we thoroughly check our 
            options and tried not limit oursevles to major cities or attractions. After a few days of 
            searching and my husband stumbled on a heart-stopping photo.    
         </p>
         <p>The Swing.
         </p>
         <p>The breathtaking scenery of a person seemingly swinging over the water, all while 
            looking across to a beautiful mountain landscape, is what travel bloggers and Instagram 
            model's dreams are made of. Yet, it appears to be an untapped travel spot. There was 
            a real shortage of articles and tagged Instagram photos which led us to think 
            “Why aren't more people going there?”. After hours of research, the answer became clear, 
            there is a severe lack of information.

         <p>Finding out where was easy, but how was hard.
         </p>
         <p>It only took a simple search to find that the swing sits at the charming restaurant 
            of Christian Gaard, a family legacy handed down through generations that rests on 
            the hillside village of Trandal in the Hjørundfjord area, hours north of Bergen and 
            a just couple hours south of Alesund. There are only two ways in, by ferry across 
            a fjord or by hiking across the mountain.
         </p>
         <p>This is where things start to get hazy. At the time no sites, including Christian 
            Gaard's own, offer reservation or even mention lodging, amenities, or even mere 
            hours of operation. Could you actually stay there? Is the swing accessible 
            throughout all seasons? The Gaard website wasn't supplying answers and travel 
            forums were severally lacking in any first-hand experience. We kept digging. And 
            after many attempts to reach out to Gaard by phone and facebook we finally got a 
            message back saying we were welcome to stay.
         </p>
         
         <h1>The trip</h1>
         
         <p>Coming from the United States flew into Bergen from New York and then begun the eight-hour 
            drive to Trandal. We were hoping to view a taste of the Nordic countryside while stopping 
            for a sleep along the way. Most of the trip was fairly simple to plan, but we were still 
            uncertain what to expect when arriving in Trandal. 
         </p>

         <p>Our drive from Bergen to Trandal was pretty much what you'd expect. We were surrounded 
            by towering mountains and beautiful fjords from the time we left the comfort of the main 
            municipality. Eight hours and two ferries later, we arrvied. We were warmly greeted on 
            arrival and took a walk around the grounds to find the swing. It was as simple as any 
            backyard swing, but rural American could never produce such awe-inspiring views. 
            After settling in, we took a few turns on the swing. There is a decent incline under 
            the swing that leads straight into the fjord and was intimidating at first, but you become 
            more comfortable the longer you swing.

         <p class="funParagraph">The eventual photo was as, if not more, impressive than we could have ever imagined. 
            While other's might not consider a single photo worth such a long trek, the experience, 
            and view that accompanied the journey was incredible. If you're seeking a true Norwegian 
            experience that leaves you feeling like you walked straight into a travel brochure, I'd 
            suggest taking a trip to the elusive Trandal swing.
